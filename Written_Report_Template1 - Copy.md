# Kickstarting Analysis with Excel
## OVERVIEW
     Louise, a play writer is interested in starting a Crowdfunding Campaign to fund “Fever” an upcoming Play and found herself in need for information that will give her a good understanding of fundraising campaigns.

### PURPOSE
    The purpose of this analysis is to find insights and trends that will help her make informed decision from start to finish in order to achieve a successful campaign.

## ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Based on the fact that Louise is interested in the Theater category, Theater was use as a filter to find what time of the year would most Campaigns end up being successful. Looking at the data, the months of May and June have the highest number of successful outcomes than any other month and October and July have higher number of failed campaigns.
    Below are a link and a line Chart that captures a visual of the Outcome Based on Date for Theater

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    Also being a play writer using the subcategory Plays was part of the equation as she is interested in some of them. According to the data, and based on the Plays subcategory, Campaigns Goals that were $15,000 or less had a success rate of over 50% up to 76%. And goals of $15,000 to less than $35,000 had a 50% to 80% chance of failed outcomes. That being said, the Chart shows a 67% successful outcome for goals between $35,000 to $45,000 which suggests there may be some potential Outliers in the data.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
      As you can notice on the Outcomes Based on Launch Date graph, there were quite a few cancelations but not enough to make a meaningful impact on either Successful or Failed Outcomes.
      But the data in the Outcomes Based on Goal, there is striking evidence of Successful Campaigns that had higher outcomes Goals which could point to either potential Outliers.
## RESULTS
•	May and June are the best months of the year for Successful Campaigns and July and October are more likely to end up as Failed campaigns according to the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date.
•	Lower campaign goals have an overall greater chance of ending up successful according to the Outcomes based on Goals but also the is the potential for big fundraising goals to be successful as well.
•	One limitation of this dataset is we only looked closely at data points for the Theater category and Plays subcategory.
•	We could also look at the data from Bar graphs perspectives
