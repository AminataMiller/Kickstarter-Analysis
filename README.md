The study consisted in finding insights to help Louise decide how to run successful campaigns in the US and in GB.
We found out that Theater is the category that had the most successful campaigns overal and especially in the US.

The Median and average goal for successfull campaigns were much lower than for failed campaigns but the possible presence of some outliers might have skewed the numbers a little to the right.
